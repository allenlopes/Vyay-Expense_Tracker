# Getting Started with Create React App  ==>

`npx create-react-app ./`


### Before installing or degrading packages, first run this script ==>

`npm config set legacy-peer-deps true`

### After the above script had been run you can then run the following script ==>

`npm i react@16.12.0 react-dom@16.12.0 @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab @speechly/react-client @speechly/react-ui chart.js react-chartjs-2 uuid`


### Run the app in the development mode.\ by the following script ==>

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](or the specified port mentioned in the terminal after you run `npm start`) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
